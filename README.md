# Cycling Component Designs

This repository showcases a portfolio of custom-designed cycling components, engineered for triathlon and time trial performance. Each part is either field-tested or simulation-validated, designed in Fusion and/or SolidWorks, and optimized for 3D printing or CNC machining.

All files are available in `.STEP` (for editing) and `.STL` (for printing), with renders and photos included where available.
